# Performance Analysis of Merge Sort and Quick Sort Algorithms

## Project Overview

This project provides Python implementations of Merge Sort and Quick Sort algorithms. It includes functionality to empirically analyze and compare their performance characteristics across various types of datasets: random, sorted, reverse-sorted, and datasets with a high percentage of duplicate values. The primary goal is to observe practical performance in light of theoretical asymptotic complexities.

This codebase accompanies a detailed academic report which discusses the theoretical underpinnings of these algorithms, including their time and space complexities, solutions to recurrence relations, and a discussion of the empirical results obtained from running this script.

**Course:** MSCS-532-M20 - Algorithms and Data Structures

## Files in the Repository

* `sorting_algorithms.py`: The main Python script containing the implementations of Merge Sort, Quick Sort, dataset generation utilities, performance measurement functions, and graph plotting logic.
* `Image.png`: An example graph visualizing the performance comparison, typically generated by the script.
* `requirements.txt`: A file listing Python package dependencies required for graph generation.
* `README.md`: This document.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x (developed and tested with Python 3.7+)

## Dependencies

The core sorting algorithms and performance timing do not have external dependencies beyond standard Python libraries. However, for generating the performance comparison graph, the following packages are required:

* `pandas`: Used for organizing performance data into a DataFrame.
* `matplotlib`: Used for plotting the performance graph.

These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/avrulesyou/MSCS532_Assignment2.git](https://github.com/avrulesyou/MSCS532_Assignment2.git)
    cd MSCS532_Assignment2
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Navigate to the directory containing `requirements.txt` and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will install `pandas` and `matplotlib`. If you choose not to generate graphs or manage these packages manually, this step can be skipped, but the graph generation part of the script will raise an `ImportError`.

## Running the Code

To execute the performance analysis script:

1.  Ensure you are in the project's root directory (where `sorting_algorithms.py` is located) in your terminal or command prompt.
2.  If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated.
3.  Run the script using the Python interpreter:
    ```bash
    python sorting_algorithms.py
    ```

The script will:
* Iterate through predefined dataset sizes.
* For each size, generate various types of datasets (random, sorted, etc.).
* Run both Merge Sort and Quick Sort on each dataset.
* Print the execution time for each sorting operation to the console.
* Display an aggregate summary table of all performance results in the console.
* Attempt to generate and display a plot visualizing the performance comparison. A window with the graph should appear.

## Example Output Format

The script produces detailed output in the console.
